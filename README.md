A great blog for navigating NYU CS. A little old but definitely worth reading during your time here. As a note, the writer may have been incredibly pessimistic about NYU CS but they make it a point to encourage the reader to work hard outside the university and find success in your own way.

I also enjoyed reaqding these blogs. I think the CS department at NYU should have clubs/organizations focused or dedicated to the things that this blog talks about!
